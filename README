TODO

- pick a place for tresure to be
- give feedback on where tresure is (after digging a hole)
- create mobs the come out of holes
- add ability to attack mobs
- make mobs attack player
- allow player to fall into holes
- add start screem
- add end screen
- add sfx

Current game idea:
You did a hole to find the tresure
Once you dig a hole you get a number letting you know how many blocks away you are
Underground mobs will appear from holes over time
